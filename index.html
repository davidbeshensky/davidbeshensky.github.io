            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer with a unique background in
                    chemistry and research. After years in the lab, I
                    transitioned to tech to pursue my passion for building
                    practical, user-centered applications. My scientific
                    background gives me a methodical approach to
                    problem-solving, while my creative side drives me to craft
                    elegant solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me salsa dancing, at the
                    gym, or gaming with my friends. Connecting with others is my
                    true passion, which is why I believe in building technology
                    that enhances people's lives and makes complex tasks feel
                    simple and intuitive.

                            I believe in building software that solves real

                        <p>
                            My transition was driven by a growing interest in
                            technology and a desire to create tools that could
                            help others. I began with self-teaching and online
                            courses, building small projects that solved
                            problems I encountered in my life, and eventually
                            returning to UW-Madison to pursue a capstone
                            certificate in computer science. The analytical
                            thinking and attention to detail from my scientific
                            background transferred well to building software!

                            help people navigate everyday challenges with
                            confidence. My best ideas often come from my own
                            life: building a weight tracker to support my gym
                            routine, mapping out salsa events to fuel my love
                            for dance, or creating a social planner to help my
                            friends and I actually find time to hang out. When a
                            project is rooted in real needs, I’m all in.
